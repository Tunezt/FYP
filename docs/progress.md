## Pre-build — brief reconciliation against written capstone proposal (Chapter 3)

Before Phase 0 started, `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` was corrected against the written capstone proposal to resolve real inconsistencies and close a couple of build-time gaps. Five changes were made:

1. **Onboarding entry point reconciled to dashboard-first.** The brief previously implied WhatsApp-first identity with no login anywhere. The proposal (Chapter 3) specifies onboarding starts on the web dashboard: owner registers there, fills in the business profile, creates staff accounts (name + PIN), and only then moves to WhatsApp for day-to-day operation. Section 5 (auth design) and Section 8 Scenario 1 were rewritten to match. This also required a real technical fix, not just a reshuffle: phone verification during dashboard registration/login now uses a WhatsApp **Authentication-category template** rather than a free-form message, because Authentication templates work without an already-open 24-hour session window — a brand-new owner has never messaged the business number before, so a free-form OTP message would have been rejected by Meta. This became a second template to submit for review (alongside the existing Utility alert template), and it's more urgent than the alert template since it's needed as soon as the dashboard login flow exists (Phase 0/1), not just by Phase 5.

2. **Attendance tracking marked explicitly out of scope.** The proposal mentions attendance as a possible function-calling use case; it is a deliberate, documented omission from this build — no `attendance` table, tool, or WhatsApp intent. Noted in the brief's scope-philosophy section so it reads as an intentional decision rather than a silent gap if anyone (including a grader) looks for it.

3. **Receipt image storage pinned to Supabase Storage.** `receipts.image_url` was previously unspecified as to where the actual file lives. Now explicitly Supabase Storage — same platform as the DB, RLS-compatible, one less external service — using a **private bucket** with access scoped per business, not a public bucket.

4. **Vision confirmation gate added as a correctness requirement, not polish.** Gemini vision-parsing handwritten Bahasa Indonesia/Malay receipts and stock books is the single biggest technical risk in the project. The brief now requires: on a low-confidence or ambiguous extraction, send the owner a WhatsApp confirmation summarizing what was read, and only write to the DB after they confirm. Never silently commit a low-confidence parse. Applies to both Scenario 1 (onboarding stock-book photo) and Scenario 5 (ongoing receipt processing).

5. **`request_logs` extended for CP2 evaluation.** Added `raw_query` and `classified_intent` columns so response-accuracy (which intent path was chosen vs. what the query actually needed) can be computed later from logs alone, without manual reconstruction. Minimal addition — two columns on an existing table, not a new system.

**Status:** brief corrected, no code written yet. Next step is Phase 0 (see `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` Section 12).

## Phase 0 — scaffold (2026-07-07)

**Done:**
- Fresh `git init` at the `FYP/` folder root. Two structural notes: (1) the *home directory* `C:\Users\PF4B3` is itself (apparently accidentally) a git repository — unavoidable; this project repo is fully independent (own `.git`, own history) and git treats nested independent repos correctly. (2) The brief's Section 3 sketch names the repo folder `fyp-business-assistant/`; since `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` and `docs/progress.md` already lived directly in `FYP/`, `FYP/` itself is the repo root — creating a nested folder would have orphaned the existing docs. Product name: **Warung Pintar**.
- Backend skeleton: FastAPI app (`backend/app/`) with `/health`, CORS, latency-header middleware, config via pydantic-settings (placeholder-safe defaults so the app boots without credentials), async SQLAlchemy engine (asyncpg, `statement_cache_size=0` for PgBouncer/Supabase-pooler compatibility), RLS tenant helper (`set_config('app.current_business_id', …, is_local)` per transaction).
- Full schema migration `alembic/versions/0001_initial_schema.py` — the Section 6 DDL **verbatim** (7 entities + `metric_baselines` + `request_logs`, all indexes, HNSW vector index, RLS enable/force + `tenant_isolation` policy on every business-scoped table), plus **two additive support tables**:
  - `pending_confirmations` (RLS'd) — the Section 4 confirmation gate requires holding a parsed-but-unconfirmed vision/Excel extraction somewhere until the owner replies YES; the locked schema has no state store for that. Additive, no changes to existing tables.
  - `login_otps` — server-side OTP state for dashboard login (hash, attempts counter, expiry). Keyed by phone, which may not belong to any business yet during registration, so deliberately not business-scoped / no RLS. Stores a hash, never the code.
- SQLAlchemy models mirroring the DDL 1:1; alembic wired to `DATABASE_URL` (async env).
- Frontend skeleton: Next.js 15 + TS + Tailwind 3.4, hand-written (no create-next-app). iOS-Native Glass design tokens established day one in `globals.css`/`tailwind.config.ts` (light/dark adaptive CSS vars, glass card/button/field components, accent gradient, spring-ish keyframes). POS opt-out hook already in place: `data-theme="pos-light"` on `<html>` forces the light high-contrast variant.
- Deploy configs: `backend/railway.json` (migrate-then-serve start command, `/health` healthcheck) + `Procfile`; Vercel needs no config (auto-detects Next.js in `frontend/`). `.env.example` for both apps documenting every variable.
- `docs/whatsapp-templates.md`: both templates (Utility `business_alert`, Authentication `login_otp`) fully specified and ready to paste into Meta Business Manager.
- Both dependency installs verified (backend venv + `npm install`); FastAPI app imports clean.

**Key decisions:**
- Background jobs will NOT literally use the Supabase `service_role` API key for DB access — that key authenticates PostgREST, not direct Postgres connections. The brief's *intent* (loop per business explicitly, never an accidental cross-tenant query) is implemented more strictly: jobs list businesses via the un-RLS'd `businesses` table, then open a tenant-scoped transaction per business, so RLS stays active even for jobs. Flagging per the brief's "flag, don't silently deviate" rule — this is the same isolation guarantee, enforced harder.
- `request_logs` RLS policy (locked) rejects rows with NULL `business_id`; inbound WhatsApp messages from unknown senders therefore log to the app logger only, not the DB. Acceptable: CP2 evaluation only concerns resolved-business interactions.
- Dry-run mode for outbound WhatsApp: with placeholder credentials, sends are logged instead of attempted, so the entire inbound pipeline is exercisable locally by POSTing simulated webhook payloads. In development mode, the OTP code is also logged for testing the dashboard login without WhatsApp delivery.

**Blocked on credentials (everything scaffolded with placeholders; none of this blocks writing/testing code):**
- **Supabase project** → `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`; run `alembic upgrade head`; create private `receipts` storage bucket. Also blocks: live RLS + concurrency tests (no local Postgres/Docker on this machine — those tests are written to auto-skip unless `DATABASE_URL` points at a real Postgres).
- **Google AI Studio** → `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. Blocks live Gemini calls (classification/tools/vision/embeddings); all AI modules are unit-tested with mocks.
- **Meta developer account + WhatsApp product** → `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET`, `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN`; **submit both message templates immediately when this exists** (`docs/whatsapp-templates.md` is copy-paste ready). Blocks live webhook verification + any real message delivery.
- **Vercel + Railway projects** → deploy pipelines (configs are committed and ready to link).

## Phase 1 — thin vertical slice (2026-07-07)

**Done (POS-write → WhatsApp-read across the whole stack):**
- **Seed** (`python -m app.seed`): fictional café *Kopi Kenangan Senja*, owner Ibu Ratna (+62 812-0000-1111, PIN 1234) + staff Sari (2345) / Budi (3456), 11 items (sellable drinks/food in servings + raw materials in kg/liter), 30 days of deterministic sales history with weekend bumps and a planted spike yesterday (so anomaly detection has something to find in Phase 5), sample expenses. Idempotent (delete-and-recreate).
- **POS backend**: pairing-token boot (`GET /pos/business/{token}` — business name + active staff), PIN login (`POST /pos/login` → scope="pos" JWT carrying staff_id), item list, `POST /pos/sales` using the brief's **atomic conditional UPDATE verbatim** (zero rows → 409 insufficient stock) + the Section 7 synchronous post-sale velocity check + a request_logs row per sale.
- **Stock-velocity service** (`services/velocity.py`) written now because the post-sale check needs it: 14-day trailing window, `days_remaining = current_stock / avg_daily_usage`, threshold from `LOW_STOCK_DAYS_THRESHOLD` (default 3), severity tiers (≤1d high / ≤2d medium / else low), and de-dup (no new alert while an unacknowledged low_stock alert exists for the item — prevents alert-per-sale storms). The nightly job (Phase 5) reuses this module.
- **WhatsApp webhook**: GET handshake, POST with raw-body HMAC `X-Hub-Signature-256` validation (constant-time compare; placeholder secret → dev-only skip with warning, hard 500 in production), immediate 200 ack with processing deferred to a background task. Processor: message-id LRU de-dup (Meta redelivers), business resolution by `owner_phone`, polite reply to unregistered numbers (session window is open — they just messaged us), per-message request_logs row (raw query, classified intent, latency, status), crash-safe error reply.
- **AI layer, first flow**: `get_stock` tool (ILIKE partial-name matching, "not found → here's what IS tracked" shape), response composer as a deliberately separate Gemini call, `clarify` fallback.
- **POS frontend** (`/pos/[businessToken]`): kiosk state machine — staff picker (initial avatars) → 4-digit PIN pad (shake on wrong PIN, no wrong-name/wrong-PIN oracle) → item grid (big targets, stock badges, out-of-stock disabled) → quantity sheet → success flash with remaining stock. Pairing persisted to localStorage; 🔒 Kunci relocks to the staff picker. Forced light high-contrast theme via `data-theme="pos-light"`.
- **Tests**: 19 passing (PIN hashing/salting, JWT scopes/expiry/tampering, webhook handshake + signature accept/reject/missing + prod-placeholder guard, router classification outcomes with Gemini mocked).
- Frontend production build verified clean.

**Key decisions:**
- **Intent classification = one forced tool call over the whole tool set** (`FunctionCallingConfig(mode="ANY")`), not a separate `classify_intent` schema followed by a second tool-selection call. The chosen function *is* the classification (its name is what request_logs records), which keeps the routing to a single Flash round-trip — half the latency of classify-then-call on the hot path. Same semantics as the brief's Section 4 (exactly one route per message, fixed tool set, no free-form SQL); flagged here since the mechanism differs from a literal reading.
- POS `unit_price` is prefilled from the item but overridable per sale (counter discounts); always server-validated ≥ 0.
- Latency for WhatsApp interactions is measured from processing start (post-ack) — webhook ack time is Meta-facing and logged separately by the middleware header.

**Verification status:** everything testable without credentials is tested and passing. Live round-trip (real webhook → Gemini → WhatsApp reply) still blocked on Meta + Gemini keys — the dry-run path (simulated webhook POST, logged outbound) is the local stand-in.
